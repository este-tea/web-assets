'styles-post.scss' Instructions
===============================

**NOTE:** The `styles-post.scss` file is only for changes post-launch.

When there has been a launch and hot fixes are needed. This style sheet is to output quick changes. Variables are imported and can be referenced in these styles. The css file to copy is found in the compiled site folder at `_squeegee/css/styles-post.css`

This file **should not** import more css than is needed to keep the fixes lean.

All changes should be fixed in the main files too. That way this file can be cleared when development resumes and the changes will already be applied to the development code.
